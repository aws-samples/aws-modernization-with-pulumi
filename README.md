# Pulumi Modern Infrastructure as Code

This workshop teaches you Modern Infrastructure as Code (IaC) concepts through a series of hands-on labs, using [Pulumi](http://pulumi.com/).
Topics covered include IaC fundamentals, in addition to application architectures and how to use IaC to create, update, and manage them.

## Building the Website
